Of course you can also look for the diagrams on your own. So i�m doing the cat school gear quest, and i have to find this boots upgrade.i know exactly where the chest with the upgrade is located, in the cave, but the chest ain�t showing any interaction, plus i can�t find. Just following this guide will give you the gear, without the need for the map and quest, so you can just skip it. Pin auf Witcher Art.</p>
